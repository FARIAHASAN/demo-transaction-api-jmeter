# Project Title: Performance testing on the rest API of Dmoney,a sample finance website, using Jmeter
## Project Summary: In this project, I've crafted a workflow enabling administrators to log in and create new user profiles for Customers, Agents, and Merchants. Funds are deposited into Agents' accounts via a distinctive Agent type called SYSTEM. Agents possess the capability to both deposit funds into and withdraw funds from Customers' accounts. Customers, in turn, can initiate payments to Merchants. Additionally, users of any type can access and review their own account balances.
